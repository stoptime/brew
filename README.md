# brew
My homebrew recipes, thus far as created with Beer Alchemy V1. 

The make-index.php file will parse the _html directory and make a dynamic listing of all recipes and batches brewed under that recipe. An an experiment it calls a golang script to sanitize the file names.

I am not sure how much longer I will be using this approach but wanted to keep all my recipes stored safely, and share them - use and brew at will! 

FWIW water type is City of Chicago water - many of my favorite recipes that I brew often have detailed water chem notes, these include:

* Eagle Stout
* Beggar's Canyon IPA
* This is It IPA
* Janet's Brown
* TOF Joe IPA (Hazy)
* Stevie's Session
